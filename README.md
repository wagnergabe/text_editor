GIVEN a text editor web application<br>
WHEN I open my application in my editor<br>
THEN I should see a client-server folder structure<br>
WHEN I run `npm start` from the root directory<br>
THEN I find that my application should start up the back end and serve the client<br>
WHEN I run the text editor application from my terminal<br>
THEN I find that my JavaScript files have been bundled using webpack<br>
WHEN I run my webpack plugins<br>
THEN I find that I have a generated HTML file, service worker, and a manifest file<br>
WHEN I use next-gen JavaScript in my application<br>
THEN I find that the text editor still functions in the browser without errors<br>
WHEN I open the text editor<br>
THEN I find that IndexedDB has immediately created a database storage<br>
WHEN I enter content and subsequently click off of the DOM window<br>
THEN I find that the content in the text editor has been saved with IndexedDB<br>
WHEN I reopen the text editor after closing it<br>
THEN I find that the content in the text editor has been retrieved from our IndexedDB database<br>
WHEN I click on the Install button<br>
THEN I download my web application as an icon on my desktop<br>
WHEN I load my web application<br>
THEN I should have a registered service worker using Workbox<br>
WHEN I register a service worker<br>
THEN I should have my static assets precached upon loading along with subsequent pages and static assets<br>
WHEN I deploy to Heroku<br>
THEN I should have proper build scripts for a webpack application
